# Olist E-Commerce Analytics | 2016 - 2018
End-to-end analytics engineering project built using Snowflake, dbt, and Tableau to analyze e-commerce performance, delivery efficiency, and customer behavior.

---

## Project Overview

This project transforms raw e-commerce data into a clean analytical model and delivers business insights through interactive dashboards.

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze **revenue trends and growth**
- Evaluate **delivery performance and delays**
- Understand **customer and seller behavior**
- Identify **geographic revenue distribution across Brazil**

---

## Architecture

Raw Data → Snowflake → dbt Models → Tableau Dashboard

- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse  
- **dbt**: Data transformation and modeling  
- **Tableau**: Data visualization 

---

## Data Modelling (dbt)

The project follows a layered modeling approach:

### 🔹 Staging Layer (`stg_*`)
- Cleans and standardizes raw data

### 🔹 Intermediate Layer (`int_*`)
- Joins and enriches datasets  
- Examples:
  - `int_orders_enriched`
  - `int_products_enriched`
  - `int_payments_agg`

---

### 🔹 Fact Table

#### `fct_orders`
**Grain:** One row per order

**Key Columns:**
- `order_id`
- `customer_id`
- `purchased_at`
- `delivered_customer_at`

**Derived Metrics:**
- `delivery_time_days`
- `approval_delay_days`
- `is_delivered`
- `is_late_delivery`
- `payment_diff`
- `is_payment_mismatch`

---

### 🔹 Mart Layer (`mart_*`)
Business-ready aggregated tables:

- `mart_customer_analytics`
- `mart_product_performance`
- `mart_seller_performance`
- `mart_category_performance`
- `mart_order_funnel`

---
